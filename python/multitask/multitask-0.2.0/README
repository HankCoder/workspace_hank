Introduction
------------

multitask allows Python programs to use generators (a.k.a. coroutines)
to perform cooperative multitasking and asynchronous I/O.
Applications written using multitask consist of a set of cooperating
tasks that yield to a shared task manager whenever they perform a
(potentially) blocking operation, such as I/O on a socket or getting
data from a queue.  The task manager temporarily suspends the task
(allowing other tasks to run in the meantime) and then restarts it
when the blocking operation is complete.  Such an approach is suitable
for applications that would otherwise have to use select() and/or
multiple threads to achieve concurrency.

multitask is free software, distributed under the MIT license.


Requirements
------------

multitask requires Python 2.5 or later.  No additional software is
required.


Documentation
-------------

multitask provides extensive online documentation, which can be
accessed from the Python prompt via 'help(multitask)'.  In addition,
the examples directory contains scripts that demonstrate basic usage
of the module.
