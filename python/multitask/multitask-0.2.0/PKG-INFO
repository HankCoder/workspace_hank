Description: multitask allows Python programs to use generators (a.k.a. coroutines)
        to perform cooperative multitasking and asynchronous I/O.
        Applications written using multitask consist of a set of cooperating
        tasks that yield to a shared task manager whenever they perform a
        (potentially) blocking operation, such as I/O on a socket or getting
        data from a queue.  The task manager temporarily suspends the task
        (allowing other tasks to run in the meantime) and then restarts it
        when the blocking operation is complete.  Such an approach is suitable
        for applications that would otherwise have to use select() and/or
        multiple threads to achieve concurrency.
